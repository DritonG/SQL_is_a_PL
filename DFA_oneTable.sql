-- SEMINAR: SQL is a Programming Language
-- TOPIC: query-pattern recognition with finite automaton
-- Bei der Analyse von Zeichenketten kann es interessant sein, ob diese einem bestimmten Muster entsprechen
-- (etwa: befindet sich das Wort "Fotografie" in einer anderen Variante, "Photographie", "Photografie" oder
-- "Fotographie" in einem Text?). Eine solche Mustererkennung kann mittels endlicher Automaten ermittelt
-- werden, welche sich in SQL auf unterschiedliche Arten darstellen lassen.

-- ROUGH APPROACH:
-- formulate regular expressions with deterministic finite automaton(dfa_t)
-- how can we represent a graph in SQL https://inviqa.com/blog/storing-graphs-database-sql-meets-social-network
-- how to split strings in SQL  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/functions-string.html


-- dfa_ts consists of 5-Tuple: (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)  <--- typical variable specification
-- dfa_ts consists of 5-Tuple, (S, A, T, s_0, F)
--      S = finite set of dfa_t
--      A = input Alphabet(set of symbols)
--      T = Transition function from a state "s_x" to another State "s_y" given A
--      s_0 = start State of a word, s_0 is element of S
--      F = set of Finite dfa_t which is a subset of S

DROP TABLE dfa_t; -- Tuple S
